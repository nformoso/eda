# EDA
## Estimation of distribution algorithm (Octave implementation)

## Usage
1. Clone / Download
2. Open Octave
3. Get into decompressed/cloned directory
4. Run: main (and press enter)

## NOTES
1. Due to some renderization problems, the function
         'text' could throw a warning during execution.
2. Due to some octave limitations (or maybe my
         knowing limitations), rendering long text may
         produce problems with output text visualization.
